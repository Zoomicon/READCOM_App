Under development, can try early releases here:
https://github.com/Zoomicon/READCOM_App/releases


## HowTo: enable SVG previews for File Add/Open Dialogs on Windows

To have SVG preview at Add/Open file dialogs (if Preview pane is enabled at Windows Explorer), install Microsoft PowerToys from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/install

Alternatively try this one which uses the same SVG library as the READ-COM App (however it sometimes freezes Windows Explorer): https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGShellExtensions/releases

## Requirements: Source-code Dependencies:
* need to install latest [TFrameStand package](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/?q=tframestand) via "Tools/GetIt Package Manager" in Delphi IDE to build the project
