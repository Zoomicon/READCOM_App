  TODO:
    <ul>
      <li>USE GITHUB ISSUES/SUGGESTIONS FOR THE ITEMS BELOW</li>
      <li>Add Camera capture to ImageStoryItem</li>
      <li>Merge VectorImageStoryItem and BitmapImageStoryItem</li>
      <li>Add Recording action to AudioItem</li>
      <li>When mainform size or orientation is changed, should zoom to active story item again (or remember the old zoom bounds - keep it at each zoom - and zoom to it again)
      <li>Should use asmoContained selection mode at AreaSelector by default - make it 1st in the enumeration, but also explicit in the areaselector and set as respective property default value too</li>
      <li>Add UserGuide.pdf with Release - maintain as .md document in some "documentation/user guide in the repository (or maintain in the online wiki instead?) and make PDF from it</li>
      <li>put a _ClassName_NewGUID at the end of the name of a StoryItem (instead of FilenameSanitized_randomNumber) so that we can save and share parts of the story without naming conflicts at load (and to ease targeting). Should properly rename component when loading media content directly to it (not adding children). If loading readcom file that contains that in the filename (or maybe not make class andOr GUID visible when saving) then try to respect them if no naming conflict - at naming conflicts try autorenaming and doing action automatically if possible (cannot do for sub-children though unless renaming the item we already had loaded that was causing conflict - in case of multiple conflicts it may mean long retries of loading till they all disappear)</li>
