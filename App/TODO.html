  TODO:
    <ul>
      <li>Add Camera capture to ImageStoryItem</li>
      <li>Merge VectorImageStoryItem and BitmapImageStoryItem</li>
      <li>Add Recording action to AudioItem</li>
      <li>When mainform size or orientation is changed, should zoom to active story item again (or remember the old zoom bounds - keep it at each zoom - and zoom to it again)
      <li>Should use asmoContained selection mode at AreaSelector by default - make it 1st in the enumeration, but also explicit in the areaselector and set as respective property default value too</li>
      <li>Add UserGuide.pdf with Release - maintain as .md document in some "documentation/user guide in the repository (or maintain in the online wiki instead?) and make PDF from it</li>
    </ul>
